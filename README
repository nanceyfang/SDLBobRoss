Project description: (Also, what image did you draw?)
An image created with the SDL using the SDL 2.0 primitives. This project is
used to get practice with classes and the SDL.
I drew a landscape based on a painting by Bob Ross. The landscape is of 
mountains, hills, a lake, two swaying trees, moving clouds, and an 
imported image of Bob Ross. 

The easiest part of this project:
Finding a quote from Bob Ross for the overloaded output operator that prints 
out the position of the Tree objects. The quote is: "That's a crooked tree.
We'll send him to Washington."

Problems that I had in completing this project:
Figuring out how to import an image and rendering it to the frame. I had to
load it in as a bmp file as a surface, convert it to a texture, and then 
delete the old surface. The image is then copied on to a rectangle that I
placed where I wanted the imported image to appear.
